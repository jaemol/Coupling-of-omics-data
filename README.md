#### Coupling of omics data ####
The purpose of this project is twofold; 

firstly, to address the issue of dealing with multiple datasets of different omics and variables, thus attempting to find and / or implement a systematic method or approach of combining two or more matrices, using multivariate statistics and mathematical modelling. 

Secondly, to use said systematic approach to examine the genomic qualities of bacteria samples, and finding their chemical usage, by looking at both taxonomic and metabolomic data.
